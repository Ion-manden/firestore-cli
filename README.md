# firestore-cli

firestore-cli is a combined cli and terminal ui created to lookup firestore documents directly from your terminal.

For now you have to build from source yourself and moving it to a globally available folder.
```
go build -o fs cmd/*.go 

sudo chmod +x fs

sudo mv fs /usr/local/bin/fs

fs
```
